Benchmarking C* on SSD
----------------------
Our EC2 instances are using /var/lib/cassandra for storage
This directory is on a EBS device -- a network drive
    --> Not very high IO
Ephemeral disks are ‘local’, and provide higher IO
Your instance might have a SSD (flash drive) as local drive (verify with instructor)

Use 'df -kh'  command to see what disks are available.

Let's see the IO throughput on both devices. we will use 'dd' command

    $   sudo dd  if=/dev/zero  of=/tmp/a   bs=1M  count=1000  conv=fsync

Explanation:
    - if : input file,  we read from a special device file that always returns zero
    - of : output file, destination file we want to write to
    - bs : block size , 1 Mega bytes
    - count : how many blocks to write, 1000
    - conv : fsync forces dd to flush data to disk at the end
    - we are writing 1G of data (1M x 1000)

Now do the same dd command to ephemeral disk.  Change the output file to a file on ephemeral disk (e.g. :  /media/ephemeral0/a)

Any noticeable difference?

Let's use the local drives for C*
    - stop C*
        $  sudo service cassandra stop

    - move cassandra directories (data_file_directories,  commitlog_directory) from EBS storage to ephemeral storage.

           $  sudo mv /var/lib/cassandra  /media/ephemeral0/

           # create a symlink so  we don't need to change C* config
           $  sudo ln -s /media/ephemeral0/cassandra  /var/lib/cassandra

    - restart C*
        $  sudo service cassandra start

    - verify C* is running

    - do benchmarks (cassandra-stress tool) and compare
