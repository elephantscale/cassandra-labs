# Lab 4.3 : Materialized Views

### Overview

Using materialized views

Restrictions for materialized views:

- Include all of the source table's primary keys in the materialized view's primary key.
- Only one new column can be added to the materialized view's primary key. Static columns are not allowed.
- Exclude rows with null values in the materialized view primary key column.

### Run time

15 mins

## STEP 1:  Launch CQLSH

```bash
    $   ~/apps/cassandra/bin/cqlsh
```

## Step 2 - Create a materialized view

We will create a materialized view for `features` table

We will query using `studio`

Note: If you had created an index for studio column, go ahead and drop it now!  
Check CQL document for `drop index` syntax.

```sql

cqlsh>
    create materialized view features_by_studio
    as select code, name, studio, release_date
    from features
    where code is not null and studio is not null
    primary key (studio, code);
```

## Step 3 - Check materialized view

```sql
cqlsh>
    DESC MATERIALIZED VIEW features_by_studio ;
```

## Step 4 - Run Queries on Materialized View

```sql
    cqlsh>
        select * from features_by_studio;
```

**Q ==> What do you see the output?**

**Q ==> Do a query with a where clause.  Does the query return results?**

```sql
    cqlsh>
        select * from features_by_studio where studio = 'Movie';
```

## Step 5 - Insert a new data

**Insert a new row:**

```sql
    cqlsh>
        INSERT into features(code, name, studio)
        VALUES ('bad', 'Breaking Bad', 'TV Show');
```

**Check new data in `features`**

```sql
    cqlsh> 
        select * from features;
```

**Check new data in materialized view**

```sql
    cqlsh>
        select * from features_by_studio;
```

**Run a query**

```sql
    cqlsh>
        select * from features_by_studio where studio = 'TV Show';
```

## Bonus Lab

Create another materialized view for another column, say `type` or `release_date`
