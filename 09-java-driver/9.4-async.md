Lab 9.4: Java Drivers / Asynchronous Query
====================

### Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to perform asynchronous queries using the DataStax Java Driver 3.x for Cassandra. You will write a Java application that connects to the cluster, executes a query asynchronously, and processes the results.

### Depends On

- Lab 9.1: Java Drivers / Connect
- Lab 9.2: Java Drivers / Insert Data
- Lab 9.3: Java Drivers / Query Data

### Run Time

30 minutes

### Java Driver Documentation

[DataStax Java Driver 3.x Documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.11/)

### Editing Files

You can use `nano`, `vim`, or `vscode` to edit files.

---

## STEP 1: Set Up Your Project Structure

Navigate to your projects directory and ensure you have the necessary directories:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir -p src/main/java/com/es/cassandra
```

## STEP 2: Create the Java Class

Create and edit the `AsyncQuery.java` file:

```bash
$ nano src/main/java/com/es/cassandra/AsyncQuery.java
```

Or use your preferred text editor:

```bash
$ vim src/main/java/com/es/cassandra/AsyncQuery.java
```

Copy the following code into `AsyncQuery.java`. **Note:** Some parts of the code are left incomplete for you to fill in.

```java
package com.es.cassandra;

import java.text.NumberFormat;

import com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster;
import com.datastax.driver.core.ResultSetFuture;
import com.datastax.driver.core.Row;
import com.datastax.driver.core.Session;

// Javadocs: https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/3.11/

public class AsyncQuery {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getInstance();

    // TODO-1: Specify the contact point (e.g., "localhost")
    Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder().addContactPoint("???").build();
    System.out.println("### Connected to " + cluster.getClusterName());

    // TODO-2: Connect to your keyspace (e.g., "myflix")
    Session session = cluster.connect("???");

    // Asynchronous call is non-blocking
    // TODO-3: Construct the CQL query to select all entries from the "users" table
    String cql = "SELECT ??? FROM users";

    long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    ResultSetFuture results = session.executeAsync(cql);
    long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();

    int counter = 0;
    long t3 = System.currentTimeMillis();

    // The getUninterruptibly() method is a blocking call that waits for the query to complete
    for (Row row : results.getUninterruptibly()) {
      counter++;
      // TODO-4: Extract and print the user_name from each row
      String userName = row.getString("user_name");
      System.out.println("### " + counter);
      System.out.println("### user_name: " + userName);
    }
    long t4 = System.currentTimeMillis();

    System.out.println("### Async query execution time: " + nf.format(t2 - t1) + " ms");
    System.out.println(
        String.format("### Iterated through %s users in %s milliseconds. (%s reads/sec)",
            nf.format(counter),
            nf.format(t4 - t3),
            nf.format(counter * 1000.0 / (t4 - t3))));

    session.close();
    cluster.close();
  }

}
```

**Your Task:**

- **TODO-1:** Replace `"???"` with the appropriate contact point, such as `"localhost"`.
- **TODO-2:** Replace `"???"` with the name of your keyspace, such as `"myflix"`.
- **TODO-3:** Complete the CQL query to select all columns from the `users` table.
- **TODO-4:** Ensure that the `user_name` is extracted and printed correctly.

**Note:** Ensure that the keyspace `myflix` and the table `users` exist in your Cassandra cluster, and that the table has data. If not, refer to Lab 9.2 to insert data before running this application.

## STEP 3: Configure Your Maven `pom.xml`

Ensure your `pom.xml` file includes the necessary dependencies and plugins. Edit the `pom.xml` file in the root directory of your project:

```bash
$ vim pom.xml
```

Update it with the contents of the following file:

[POM file](pom.xml)

**Explanation:**

- **Dependencies:**
    - We include the `cassandra-driver-core` dependency version `3.2.0`.

- **Properties:**
    - Set the Java compiler source and target versions to `11` (Java 11).

- **Plugins:**
    - **Maven Compiler Plugin:** Compiles your Java source code.
    - **Maven Assembly Plugin:** Packages your application into an executable JAR with all dependencies included.

## STEP 4: Prepare the Cassandra Keyspace and Table

Before running the application, ensure that the keyspace and table exist and contain data.

### Keyspace and Table

Assuming you have already created the `myflix` keyspace and the `users` table from previous labs.

### Verify Data in `users` Table

Ensure that the `users` table has data:

```bash
$ cqlsh
cqlsh> USE myflix;
cqlsh:myflix> SELECT * FROM users;
```

If the table is empty, run the application from Lab 9.2 to insert data.

## STEP 5: Compile and Package the Application

Run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

This command will:

- Clean any previous builds.
- Compile your Java code.
- Package your application into a JAR file with all dependencies.

After the build completes, you should see a message indicating a successful build.

## STEP 6: Examine the Target Directory

List the contents of the `target` directory:

```bash
$ ls target/
```

You should see files similar to:

- `CassandraClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`: Your compiled code without dependencies.
- `CassandraClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`: Executable JAR including all dependencies.

## STEP 7: Run the Application

Execute your application using the JAR with dependencies:

```bash
$ java -jar target/CassandraClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

**Expected Output:**

```console
### Connected to Test Cluster
### Async query execution time: X ms
### 1
### user_name: user-1
### 2
### user_name: user-2
...
### Iterated through 10 users in Y milliseconds. (Z reads/sec)
```

**Notes:**

- The actual cluster name and timing will vary depending on your Cassandra setup and system performance.
- Ensure that Cassandra is running on your local machine (`localhost`).

## STEP 8: Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

- **Cassandra is Not Running:**
    - Start your Cassandra cluster.

- **Keyspace or Table Does Not Exist:**
    - Ensure that the keyspace `myflix` and the table `users` exist and contain data.

- **Dependency Issues:**
    - Ensure that your Maven dependencies are correctly specified and downloaded.

- **Java Version Compatibility:**
    - Make sure you are using Java 11. If not, adjust the `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` properties in `pom.xml` accordingly.

- **Compilation Errors:**
    - Ensure all TODOs in the code are completed.
    - Check that all necessary import statements are included.
    - Verify that your code is syntactically correct.

## STEP 9: Review and Clean Up

- Review the code to understand how asynchronous queries are performed using the Java driver.
- Note how the `executeAsync()` method is used to execute the query asynchronously.
- Observe how the `ResultSetFuture` is processed and how data is extracted from each row.
- Close the session and cluster to free up resources.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully performed an asynchronous query on a Cassandra keyspace using the DataStax Java Driver.
